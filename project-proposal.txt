EECS 475 Machine Learning Final Project Proposal

For the final project, we decided to try building a Traffic Sign Recognition System (TSR) which could be able to read a traffic sign and predict the class and meaning of this sign. The major approach to achieve TSR is using convolutional neural network.

There already existed several labeled traffic sign datasets online which could be used as the training, validation and testing set for this project.

To simplify the work we might use some existing code in data pre-processing, which mainly includes Computer Vision techniques and setup of convolutional neural network in Python.

The performance of the trained model is evaluated based on the counts of misclassification through the testing dataset and several new images.
