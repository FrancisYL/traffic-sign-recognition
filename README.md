# traffic-sign-recognition

### Achievement
We achieved a validation accuracy of 98.6% and a test accuracy of 97.3% on the dataset from the [German Traffic Sign Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

### What & How
In this project, we are going to build a Traffic Sign Recognition System through Deep Learning using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### Who
